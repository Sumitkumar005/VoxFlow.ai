# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The VoxFlow platform currently supports web calls through a text-based chat interface with basic browser text-to-speech. However, users expect a real-time voice conversation experience similar to a phone call, where they can speak naturally and hear the AI agent respond immediately with natural-sounding voice. This feature will transform the web call experience from a text chat to a seamless voice conversation using real-time audio streaming, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech technologies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user testing my voice agent, I want to have a real-time voice conversation through the web interface, so that I can experience how the agent will sound and behave during actual phone calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "Web Call" button THEN the system SHALL establish a real-time audio connection using WebRTC
2. WHEN the user speaks into their microphone THEN the system SHALL continuously stream audio to the backend for processing
3. WHEN the user stops speaking THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the end of speech and process the audio
4. WHEN the AI generates a response THEN the system SHALL stream high-quality synthesized speech back to the user in real-time
5. WHEN the conversation is ongoing THEN the system SHALL maintain low-latency audio streaming without noticeable delays

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice conversation to feel natural and responsive, so that I can properly evaluate my agent's conversational abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating that speech is being detected
2. WHEN the AI is processing speech THEN the system SHALL show a processing indicator
3. WHEN the AI is speaking THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating active speech output
4. WHEN there are audio issues THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and recovery options
5. WHEN the conversation flows THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context across multiple speech exchanges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the voice conversation easily, so that I can start, pause, and end calls as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user wants to start a voice call THEN the system SHALL request microphone permissions and establish the connection
2. WHEN the user wants to mute their microphone THEN the system SHALL provide a mute/unmute toggle button
3. WHEN the user wants to adjust volume THEN the system SHALL provide volume controls for the AI's voice
4. WHEN the user wants to end the call THEN the system SHALL cleanly terminate all audio streams and save the conversation
5. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide reconnection options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice quality to be clear and professional, so that I can accurately assess how my agent will sound to real callers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI speaks THEN the system SHALL use high-quality text-to-speech with natural intonation
2. WHEN processing user speech THEN the system SHALL use accurate speech-to-text with proper punctuation
3. WHEN there is background noise THEN the system SHALL apply noise suppression and echo cancellation
4. WHEN the audio quality is poor THEN the system SHALL provide audio quality indicators and suggestions
5. WHEN the conversation is recorded THEN the system SHALL maintain audio quality in the saved recording

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the voice conversation to integrate seamlessly with existing features, so that I can access transcripts and recordings as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the voice call ends THEN the system SHALL generate a complete transcript of the conversation
2. WHEN the voice call ends THEN the system SHALL save an audio recording of the entire conversation
3. WHEN viewing call history THEN the system SHALL display voice calls with duration and quality metrics
4. WHEN accessing a completed voice call THEN the system SHALL provide both transcript and audio playback options
5. WHEN the voice call completes THEN the system SHALL calculate accurate token usage and duration metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the voice system to be reliable and scalable, so that multiple users can have simultaneous voice conversations without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users start voice calls simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent WebSocket connections efficiently
2. WHEN processing audio streams THEN the system SHALL manage memory usage and prevent audio buffer overflows
3. WHEN network conditions vary THEN the system SHALL adapt audio quality and buffering to maintain conversation flow
4. WHEN errors occur in the voice pipeline THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for speech processing
