# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Transform VoxFlow from a single-admin system into a production-ready multi-tenant platform supporting up to 100 users. The system will enable users to manage their own API keys, create agents within limits, track usage, and provide administrators with comprehensive management capabilities. This transformation focuses on user isolation, security, scalability, and cost management while maintaining the existing core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management System

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for my own VoxFlow account so that I can create and manage my own AI agents independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL provide email, password, and organization name fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with default limits (2 agents, 1000 monthly tokens)
3. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL send an email verification link
4. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL activate their account
5. IF a user tries to register with an existing email THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create a JWT token with user ID and role information

### Requirement 2: User API Key Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely store my own API keys (Groq, Deepgram, Twilio) so that I can use VoxFlow services without sharing keys with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses API key settings THEN the system SHALL display a secure form for entering Groq, Deepgram, and Twilio credentials
2. WHEN a user saves API keys THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES-256 encryption before database storage
3. WHEN the system needs to use a user's API key THEN it SHALL decrypt the key and use it for that specific user's requests
4. IF a user hasn't configured required API keys THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with setup instructions
5. WHEN a user updates their API keys THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of key changes
6. WHEN a user deletes their account THEN the system SHALL securely delete all associated encrypted API keys

### Requirement 3: Agent Ownership and Limits

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage my own agents within my subscription limits so that I can build personalized AI assistants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an agent THEN the system SHALL associate it with their user ID
2. WHEN a user views agents THEN the system SHALL only display agents they own
3. WHEN a user tries to create an agent THEN the system SHALL check their current agent count against their limit
4. IF a user reaches their agent limit THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and suggest upgrading their plan
5. WHEN a user deletes an agent THEN the system SHALL remove it and update their agent count
6. WHEN a user upgrades their subscription THEN the system SHALL update their agent limits accordingly

### Requirement 4: Usage Tracking and Cost Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor my API usage and costs so that I can manage my spending and understand my consumption patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes an API call THEN the system SHALL track tokens used, duration, and estimated cost
2. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display current month usage statistics
3. WHEN a user approaches their monthly limits THEN the system SHALL send warning notifications
4. IF a user exceeds their monthly quota THEN the system SHALL temporarily restrict new requests
5. WHEN the system calculates costs THEN it SHALL use current API provider pricing
6. WHEN a billing period ends THEN the system SHALL reset usage counters and archive historical data

### Requirement 5: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage all users and platform operations so that I can ensure system health and user compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to admin-only routes and features
2. WHEN an admin views the user list THEN the system SHALL display all users with their status and usage
3. WHEN an admin views a user's details THEN the system SHALL show their agents, usage, and subscription information
4. WHEN an admin updates user limits THEN the system SHALL log the change and notify the user
5. IF a non-admin tries to access admin routes THEN the system SHALL return a 403 forbidden error
6. WHEN an admin performs any action THEN the system SHALL create an audit log entry

### Requirement 6: Admin Dashboard and Analytics

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view platform analytics and metrics so that I can make informed decisions about system performance and growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display total users, active users, total agents, and platform usage
2. WHEN an admin views analytics THEN the system SHALL show usage trends, popular features, and cost breakdowns
3. WHEN an admin checks system health THEN the system SHALL display API response times and error rates
4. WHEN an admin reviews user activity THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities
5. WHEN an admin exports data THEN the system SHALL generate CSV reports with relevant metrics
6. WHEN the system detects anomalies THEN it SHALL alert administrators through the dashboard

### Requirement 7: Database Security and Isolation

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be secure and isolated from other users so that my agents and usage information remain private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system stores user data THEN it SHALL enforce row-level security based on user ID
2. WHEN a user queries their data THEN the system SHALL only return records they own
3. WHEN API keys are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them with unique initialization vectors
4. WHEN the system performs database operations THEN it SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. IF a user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all associated records and encrypted keys
6. WHEN the system backs up data THEN it SHALL maintain encryption for sensitive information

### Requirement 8: Subscription and Billing Foundation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand my subscription plan and upgrade options so that I can scale my usage as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views their subscription THEN the system SHALL display current plan, limits, and usage
2. WHEN a user wants to upgrade THEN the system SHALL show available plans with feature comparisons
3. WHEN a user's usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate upgrade options
4. WHEN a subscription changes THEN the system SHALL update user limits immediately
5. IF a user downgrades THEN the system SHALL handle agent limit reductions gracefully
6. WHEN billing periods end THEN the system SHALL prepare usage summaries for future billing integration

### Requirement 9: System Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to respond quickly and reliably even as more users join the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system serves API requests THEN response times SHALL remain under 500ms for 95% of requests
2. WHEN multiple users access the system simultaneously THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests without degradation
3. WHEN the database grows THEN query performance SHALL be maintained through proper indexing
4. WHEN user count increases THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally without code changes
5. IF the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL implement rate limiting per user
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them appropriately and provide meaningful user feedback

### Requirement 10: Migration and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to migrate existing data to the new multi-tenant structure without losing any information or functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration runs THEN it SHALL preserve all existing agents and their configurations
2. WHEN existing data is migrated THEN it SHALL be associated with the appropriate admin user initially
3. WHEN the migration completes THEN all existing functionality SHALL work without changes
4. IF migration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities
5. WHEN the new schema is applied THEN it SHALL maintain backward compatibility during transition
6. WHEN migration is verified THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful data transfer
