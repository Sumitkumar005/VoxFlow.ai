## Introduction & Product Overview

**Purpose:** Build an AI-driven voice agent that calls or receives calls from students and working professionals exploring study-abroad education loans.

The agent qualifies leads, collects eligibility data, answers FAQs, and seamlessly transfers the call to a human loan expert when needed.

**Scope:**

- Outbound: Call new leads from ads, forms, or partner lists.
- Inbound: Receive student calls via a toll-free or ‚ÄúCall Now‚Äù button.
- Multilingual: Hinglish (default), English, English + Telugu.
- Phase 2 ready: Add other regional languages.

**Voice persona:** Female (23-25 yrs), warm, professional, trustworthy ‚Äî like a knowledgeable student counsellor.

---

## Problem Statement

Loan qualification today is manual, slow, and inconsistent. Counsellors waste time gathering repetitive details (country, co-applicant, collateral, etc.), leaving little bandwidth for real guidance.

An AI voice layer can pre-qualify students, surface viable lender categories instantly, and route hot leads to experts ‚Äî improving response speed, satisfaction, and conversion.
